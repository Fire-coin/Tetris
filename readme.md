## Why calculator?
### At first I tried to code in JS canvas, however I am not good at JS and I also dislike it, so I chose environment I already coded snake in.

# Features
## All tetronimos; all the shapes available
## Translations to the sides and rotations. I can move shapes from side to side and rotate them
## Deletion of rows when filled & tracking score
## Blocks falling down, when row is deleted
## Exiting the game by pressing the period button (get it? There a period before the end)
## Dynamic update of score after deleting a row
## Score table of original tetris game

# Limitations
I have only 32KB of memory, for everything on this calculator, and I use it as my personal one, so I don't want to run out of memory.

# Challenge
The CPU is slow compared to computer, so for it to not load too long I needed to optimize everything as much as possible.
